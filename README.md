## Overview

This was a group CapStone project with a combined Front End and Back End team. For the first time students were given the opportunity to work collaboratively in an agile workflow to build an application. The project demonstrates knowledge we've gained throughout Turing as well as exploring new technologies. The Front End and Back End team implemented graphQL for the first time and used circle ci for continuous integration. 

* Demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
* Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
* Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
* Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
* Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
* Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
* Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Features:
  * As a user I can Create a Trip to view a predetermined list of packing essentials and activity items.
  * As a user I can view a list of created trips.
  * As a user I can view an itemized list of packing essentials and activity items.
  * As a user I can delete items in my item list.
  * As a user I can add items to my item list.
